🧩 Main Modules

1. Authentication

Email/password login & signup via betterauth

Enforces Terms & Conditions acceptance before login

2. Product Management

Add, edit, and delete products using modal or full-page forms

Upload product images to Cloudflare R2

Display product categories and image galleries

3. Admin Dashboard

Centralized management for users, products, payments, and orders

Future plans: analytics, reports, and CMS for static data like contact info



---

💡 Static Info Management (Recent Discussion)

Static information such as contact info, about, and terms can be managed from the admin dashboard, where authorized users can update these values instead of editing code manually — this ensures flexibility and maintainability.


---

🚀 Future Goals

Add real-time analytics and reports

Enable affiliate and CPA marketing integration

Build a CMS-like control for static and SEO content

Optimize cost per 10,000 visitors (targeting low server & storage cost)
